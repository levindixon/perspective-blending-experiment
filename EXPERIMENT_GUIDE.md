# Perspective Blending Experiment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for conducting a perspective blending experiment that demonstrates how multiple viewpoints can synthesize into richer, more accurate descriptions than any single perspective alone.

## Materials Needed
- An image generation AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc.)
- 3-5 participants
- Timer
- Document for recording observations

## Step 1: Generate Source Image

Copy and paste the following prompt into your image generation AI:

```
Generate a complex scene optimized for a 60-second memory recall exercise. Requirements:

Create an image with 5-7 distinct focal elements positioned across different spatial zones (foreground left/right, midground center, background corners, etc.). Blend two contrasting thematic domains (e.g., ancient/futuristic, organic/mechanical, underwater/celestial) to elicit diverse descriptive vocabulary. Include at least one precisely countable element (e.g., "four floating crystals" or "six bronze gears") that tests numerical recall accuracy. Ensure all elements form a coherent scene despite their thematic contrasts. Describe the lighting and atmosphere in one evocative sentence.

Conclude with a one-sentence explanation of why this image serves the recall exercise effectively.
```

## Step 2: Individual Observation Phase
1. Display the generated image to all participants simultaneously
2. Set timer for 60 seconds
3. Instruct participants to observe silently and memorize as many details as possible
4. Hide the image after 60 seconds

## Step 3: Individual Recording Phase
1. Give participants 3-5 minutes to write down everything they remember
2. Encourage specific details: objects, colors, positions, quantities, atmosphere
3. Participants should work independently without discussion

## Step 4: Synthesis Phase
1. Have participants share their observations one at a time
2. Create a combined description that incorporates all unique observations
3. Note which details were remembered by multiple participants (high confidence)
4. Note which details were remembered by only one participant (lower confidence)
5. Identify any contradictory observations

## Step 5: Verification
1. Display the original image again
2. Compare the synthesized description against the source
3. Analyze:
   - What details were universally noticed?
   - What details were missed entirely?
   - Which contradictions were resolved correctly through synthesis?
   - How did the multi-perspective approach improve accuracy?

## Key Insights to Discuss
- **Attention Distribution**: Different observers naturally focus on different areas
- **Memory Reliability**: Shared observations tend to be more accurate
- **Emergent Accuracy**: The group synthesis often captures details no individual fully remembered
- **Error Correction**: Contradictions between observers can highlight and correct individual errors

## Variations
- **Expertise Variant**: Use participants with different backgrounds (artist, engineer, writer) to see how expertise affects observation
- **Time Variant**: Try 30-second or 2-minute observation periods
- **Complexity Variant**: Generate simpler or more complex images to test limits
- **Sequential Variant**: Show the image to participants one at a time to eliminate simultaneous viewing

## Recording Template
```
Participant: [Name]
Observation Time: 60 seconds
Recording Time: [Start - End]

Remembered Details:
- [Detail 1]
- [Detail 2]
- [etc.]

Confidence Level: [High/Medium/Low] for each detail
```

## Expected Outcomes
This experiment typically demonstrates that:
1. No single observer captures the complete image
2. Each perspective contributes unique valid details
3. The synthesized description is more comprehensive and accurate
4. Consensus on details correlates with accuracy
5. Diverse perspectives reduce individual biases and errors
